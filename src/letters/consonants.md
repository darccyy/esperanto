# Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced the same as in English: _b_, _d_, _f_, _g_ (as in '**g**o'), _h_, _k_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _p_, _s_, _t_, _v_, _z_

## Different pronunciations

Some different pronunciations of letters are:

- _c_ : like _ts_, as in 'pi**zz**a'
- _j_ : like _y_, as in '**y**ellow'

## New letters

New letters, with circumflexes (a 'hat' on the letter, such as _ĉ_), are:

- _ĉ_ : like _ch_, as in **ch**eese
- _ĝ_ : like _j_, as in '**j**udge'
- _ĥ_: like the 'harsh' (velar) _h_ or _ch_, as in 'lo**ch**'
- _ĵ_: like _zh_, as in 'vi**s**ion'
- _ŝ_: like _sh_, as in '**sh**adow'

The letter _ŭ_ (_u_ with a breve) is _almost_ always used after _a_, _e_, or _o_, as a [diphthong](#diphthongs).
It is often considered a vowel, but included in this chart for simplicity.
It is rarely used as a consonant, such as the word '**ŭ**aŭ' which means 'wow', and is pronounced the same.
