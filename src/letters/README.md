# Phonology and Orthography

## Phonology

A _phonology_ is the sounds of a language, and how they can be used.

Each letter in Esperanto represents one sound.

The stress (emphasis) of a word falls on the second-last syllable, always.

## Orthography

An _orthography_ is how a language is written.

The alphabet of Esperanto is similar to the English alphabet, however without the letters _q_, _w_, _x_, and _y_, and with new letters _ĉ_, _ĝ_, _ĥ_, _ĵ_, _s_, and _ŭ_.
There are 23 consonants and 5 vowels.
