# What is the Accusative?

Most verbs carry two nouns (or noun phrases).
These nouns are named '_Nominative_', for the _subject_ (the performer of the action), and '_Accusative_', for the _object_ (the affected by the action).
This is called the noun's _case_.

The _nominative_ noun in a sentence often goes before the verb, with the _accusative_ noun after.

_Eg:_

- I see you
- '_I_' is the nominative (because it is the one performing the action), '_you_' is the accusative (because it is the one having the action done to it)

> **Tip:** If you can't figure out which noun is which in an English sentence, try replacing both nouns with '**he**' or '**him**'
>
> The '**he**' noun is _nominative_, and the '**him**' noun _accusative_
>
> _Eg:_
>
> - I see you
> - Swap nouns ('_I_' and '_you_') with '**he**' and '**him**':
> - - "**he** sees **him**" sounds normal
> - - "**him** sees **he**" sounds incorrect
> - Therefore '_I_' is _nominative_, and '_you_' is _accusative_
