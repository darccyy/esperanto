# Accusative with Copula Verbs

If the [verb](./verbs.md) of the sentence is a _Copula_, then the second noun is **not** considered _accusative_ in Esperanto.

A _copula_ verb is a sort of 'linking' verb, such as 'is' in English. There are only a few in Esperanto.

Examples of _copular_ verbs include:

- estas - is / are
- estis - was / were
- estos - will be
- fariĝas - becomes / becoming
- fariĝis - became
- fariĝos - will become

The above examples are basically the only _copula_ verbs you would encounter or need when translating.

Due no noun in a sentence with a _copula_ verb having an _accusative_ suffix, the word order is less free.

_Eg:_

The sentence 'I am happy' can be translated as 'Mi estas feliĉa', **not** 'Mi estas feliĉa**n**'.

This is because 'estas' is considered a _copula_ verb.

> **Note:** Occasionally it can be another order, such as 'Mi feliĉa estas', or 'Feliĉa estas mi', however this is mainly for poetry. Don't worry about it being in this order when translating.
