# Adjectives and Adverbs

## Adjectives

Adjectives are _describing words_ for [nouns](./nouns.md).

> **Eg.** 'good', 'big', 'green'

Adjectives in Esperanto have the suffix _-a_.

Adjectives always inherit _case_ suffixes from their [noun](./nouns.md).
To mark a noun as _plural_ (multiple), use _-j_ after the _-a_.

> **Eg.**
>
> - The _brown_ dog - La _bruna_ hundo
> - The _brown_ dog**s** - La _bruna**j**_ hundo**j**

> **Don't forget:** '_brunaj_' is pronouned like 'BROON-eye'

Adjectives can be on either side of its noun.

> **Eg.**
>
> "The _brown_ dog" can be translated as either of these:
>
> - La _brun**a**_ hundo
> - La hundo _brun**a**_

They often end with '_-ly_' in English.
