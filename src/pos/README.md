# Parts of Speech

_Parts of Speech_ are categories of words.

The most basic _Parts of Speech_ are [_nouns_](./nouns.md), [_verbs_](./verbs.md), [_adjectives_](./adwords.md), [_adverbs_](./adwords.md).

[Nouns](./nouns.md), [adjectives](./adwords.md), and [adverbs](./adwords.md) often end with an [_accusative_ suffix '_-n_'](./../accusative/README.md), but this will be covered in the next chapter.
