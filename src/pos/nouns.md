# Nouns

Nouns (including proper nouns) are _things_, _people_, _places_, _concepts_, ect.

_Eg:_ 'dog', 'John', 'Australia', 'strength'

Nouns in Esperanto have the suffix _-o_.

To mark a noun as _plural_ (multiple), use _-j_ after the _-o_.

_Eg:_

- The dog - La hundo
- The dog**s** - La hundo**j**

> **Don't forget:** '_hundoj_' is pronouned like 'HOOND-oy'

Nouns and [adjectives](./adwords.md) often end with an [_accusative_ suffix '_-n_'](./../accusative/README.md), but this will be covered in the next chapter.
