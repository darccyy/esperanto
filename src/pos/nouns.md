# Nouns

Nouns (including proper nouns) are _things_, _people_, _places_, _concepts_, ect.

_Eg:_ 'dog', 'John', 'Australia', 'strength'

Nouns in Esperanto have the suffix _-o_.

To mark a noun as _plural_ (multiple), use _-j_ after the _-o_.

_Eg:_

- The dog - La hundo
- The dog**s** - La hundo**j**

> Don't forget: '_hundoj_' is pronouned like 'HOOND-oy'

## Accusative Case

Most verbs carry two nouns (or noun phrases).
These nouns are named '_Nominative_', for the _subject_ (the performer of the action), and '_Accusative_', for the _object_ (the affected by the action).
This is called the noun's _case_.

The _nominative_ noun in a sentence often goes before the verb, with the _accusative_ noun after.

_Eg:_

- I see you
- '_I_' is the nominative (because it is the one performing the action), '_you_' is the accusative (because it is the one having the action done to it)

> **Tip:** If you can't figure out which noun is which in an English sentence, try replacing both nouns with '**he**' or '**him**'
>
> The '**he**' noun is _nominative_, and the '**him**' noun _accusative_
>
> _Eg:_
>
> - I see you
> - Swap nouns ('_I_' and '_you_') with '**he**' and '**him**':
> - - "**he** sees **him**" sounds normal
> - - "**him** sees **he**" sounds incorrect
> - Therefore '_I_' is _nominative_, and '_you_' is _accusative_

The _accusative_ noun in Esperanto will _always_ have the _-n_ suffix at the _very end_ of the word.

_Eg:_

- I see you - Mi vidas vi**n**

- You see me - Vi vidas mi**n**

The _order_ of nouns around a verb is relatively free in Esperanto, so the _accusative_ can go _before_ the word, and/or the _nominative_ _after_, although this is less common.

This is why the _accusative suffix_ '_-n_' is important.

_Eg:_

The _accusative suffix_ must always be on '_vin_' **in this example**:

- "I see you" can be translated as any of these:
- - Mi vidas _vi**n**_
- - _Vi**n**_ vidas mi
- - Mi _vi**n**_ vidas
- - _Vi**n**_ mi vidas
- - Vidas mi _vi**n**_
- - Vidas _vi**n**_ mi

If a noun is _plural_ AND _accusative_, then the noun will have both the _-j_ and _-n_ suffixes, in that order.

_Eg:_

For each example, the words can be in any order, as long as the suffixes are not changed.

- I see a dog - Mi vidas hundo**n**
- I see dogs - Mi vidas hundo**jn**
- A dog sees me - Hundo vidas mi**n**
- Dogs see me - Hundo**j** vidas mi**n**

> Tip: The order of these suffixes will **always** be _o_-_j_-_n_, for _noun_, _plural_, _accusative_

## Use with Copula Verbs

If the [verb](./verbs.md) of the sentence is a _Copula_, then the second noun is **not** considered _accusative_ in Esperanto.

A _copula_ verb is a sort of 'linking' verb, such as 'is' in English. There are only a few in Esperanto.

Examples of _copular_ verbs include:

- estas - is / are
- estis - was / were
- estos - will be
- fariĝas - becomes / becoming
- fariĝis - became
- fariĝos - will become

The above examples are basically the only _copula_ verbs you would encounter or need when translating.

Due no noun in a sentence with a _copula_ verb having an _accusative_ suffix, the word order is less free.

_Eg:_

The sentence 'I am happy' can be translated as 'Mi estas feliĉa', **not** 'Mi estas feliĉa**n**'.

This is because 'estas' is considered a _copula_ verb.

> **Note:** Occasionally it can be another order, such as 'Mi feliĉa estas', or 'Feliĉa estas mi', however this is mainly for poetry. Don't worry about it being in this order when translating.
