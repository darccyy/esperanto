# Nouns

Nouns in Esperanto have the suffix _-o_.

To mark a noun as _plural_ (multiple), use _-j_ after the _-o_.

_Eg:_

- The dog - La hundo
- The dog**s** - La hundo**j**

> Don't forget: '_hundoj_' is pronouned like 'HOOND-oy'

## Accusative Case

Most verbs carry two nouns (or noun phrases).
These nouns are named '_Nominative_', for the _Subject_, and '_Accusative_', for the _Object_.
This is called the noun's _Case_.

The _nominative_ noun in a sentence often goes before the verb, with the _accusative_ noun after.

_Eg:_

- I see you
- '_I_' is the nominative, '_you_' is the accusative

> **Tip:** If you can't figure out which noun is which in an English sentence, try replacing both nouns with '**he**' or '**him**'
>
> The '**he**' noun is _nominative_, and the '**him**' noun _accusative_
>
> _Eg:_
>
> - I see you
> - Swap nouns ('_I_' and '_you_') with '**he**' and '**him**':
> - - "**he** sees **him**" sounds normal
> - - "**him** sees **he**" sounds incorrect
> - Therefore '_I_' is _nominative_, and '_you_' is _accusative_

The _accusative_ noun in Esperanto will almost _always_ have the _-n_ suffix at the _very end_ of the word.

_Eg:_

- I see you - Mi vidas vi**n**

- You see me - Vi vidas mi**n**

The _order_ of nouns around a verb is relatively free in Esperanto, so the _accusative_ can go _before_ the word, and/or the _nominative_ _after_, although this is less common.

This is why the _accusative suffix '-n'_ is important.

_Eg:_

The _accusative suffix_ must always be on '_vin_' **in this example**:

- "I see you" can be translated as any of these:
- - Mi vidas _vi**n**_
- - _Vi**n**_ vidas mi
- - Mi _vi**n**_ vidas
- - _Vi**n**_ mi vidas
- - Vidas mi _vi**n**_
- - Vidas _vi**n**_ mi

If a noun is _plural_ AND _accusative_, then the noun will have both the _-j_ and _-n_ suffixes, in that order.

_Eg:_

For each example, the words can be in any order, as long as the suffixes are not changed.

- I see a dog - Mi vidas hundo**n**
- I see dogs - Mi vidas hundo**jn**
- A dog sees me - Hundo vidas mi**n**
- Dogs see me - Hundo**j** vidas mi**n**

> Tip: The order of these suffixes will **always** be _o_-_j_-_n_, for _noun_, _plural_, _accusative_
